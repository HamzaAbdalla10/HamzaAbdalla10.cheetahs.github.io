        <p><em>The Cheetah is a large cat and is known for being the fastest of all the land animals. It can reach speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. The Cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 60 in around 3 1/2 seconds. This is faster than most sports cars! 
</em>Cheetahs are mostly found in Africa, but there is a small population of Cheetahs in the country of Iran. Cheetahs are found in a wide variety of habitats and like to live in open areas of land like the African grasslands and savanna. Female cheetahs will establish a large home range that may overlap with other female cheetahs. Males, on the other hand, will typically establish a much smaller territory.<strong>Male cheetahs will often group together in groups called coalitions. They usually group with brothers, but may also group with an existing group or other males that were the lone male in their litter. Female cheetahs, however, hunt alone with the exception of their own cubs. 
</strong>Cheetahs have a short tan coat that has small black spots which helps them to hide or be camouflaged. There are no spots on the cheetah's white stomach area. Adult cheetahs will grow to between 90 and 140 pounds and around 4 to 4.5 feet long. They have a slim body, long legs, a deep chest, and a narrow waist. The female cheetah is usually smaller than the male, but there are no major differences in appearance between the male and female cheetah.</p>
